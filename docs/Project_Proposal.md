# AI Hardware Project Proposal Template

## 1. Project Title
Name of the Team: group-group

List of students in the team
1. Claire Chiang
2. Zourong Jiang
3. Sonia Aung
4. Allison Lampe

Provide a clear and concise title for your project: Temperature Forecasting with TinyML 

## 2. Platform Selection
We will use TinyML because weather forcasting can already done adequately on the cloud, but there could be utility in being able to estimate future temperature just with a device. TinyML allows us to, in this case, get real time weather predictions in any location.


## 3. Problem Definition
Describe the AI or hardware design problem you aim to address and its relevance to AI hardware (e.g., efficiency, latency, scalability).

We aim to design an low-power, always-on voice interaction system that can operate entirely offline, without reliance on cloud-based speech recognition. Traditional voice assistants require continuous network connectivity, consume significant energy. Our system instead uses on-device keyword spotting and sensor-based temperature trend prediction on a constrained microcontroller platform.

Allison edit: We aim to design a low-power, always-on system that can operate entirely offline, without reliance on cloud-based weather data. Our system will predict whether the outside temperature will increase or decrease in the next hour based on barometric, humidity, and temperature data taken on a constrained microcontroller platform.

## 4. Technical Objectives
List 3–5 measurable objectives with quantitative targets when possible.

## 5. Methodology
Describe your planned approach: hardware setup, software tools, model design, performance metrics, and validation strategy.

## 6. Expected Deliverables
List tangible outputs: working demo, GitHub repository, documentation, presentation slides, and final report.

| 2 | Proposal | PDF + GitHub submission |
| 4 | Midterm presentation | Slides, preliminary results |
| 6 | Integration & testing | Working prototype |
